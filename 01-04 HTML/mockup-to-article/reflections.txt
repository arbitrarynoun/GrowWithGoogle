Your response goes here!

*What new skills have you learned?

I haven’t learned anything yet; I’m familiar with HTML and some CSS, so at this point it’s just review. There are tags I hadn’t used in the past, but that doesn’t seem new as much as novel. 

I suppose I could classify as new any deprecated tags I shouldn’t be using anymore, like the strikethrough tag. The lesson made me appreciate that.



*What has been easy?

So far, it’s all been pretty easy as it’s been review. That does not mean I think it’s without merit; I’m still glad to be seeing things in a formal training scenario. I’ve picked up much of what I know informally, so this is great.



*What has been difficult?

Nothing has been difficult, yet. I imagine this will ramp up.
